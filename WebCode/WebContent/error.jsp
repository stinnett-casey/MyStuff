This is an example error page.  If you look at web.xml, you'll see that
edu.byu.isys413.web.WebException is mapped to /error.jsp.  This tells
Tomcat to call /error.jsp automatically whenever a WebException is 
thrown.  
<p>
Effectively, you can <tt>throw new WebException("Error")</tt> whenever
you want to show the error page.
<p>
You obviously should replace the text of this page with something
nicer for your clients to see.
<p>
The error was as follows:
<p>

<div style="color:#FF0000" align="center">
    <%=exc%>
</div>    

<jsp:include page="/footer.jsp"/>
